__Changelog - Scrabble Project on Python__


October 27, 2023:
- Added "draw_initial_tiles" function to distribute 7 tiles to each player.
- Implemented "is_game_over" function to check if the game is finished.
- Added the option for players to enter words, pass their turn, or exchange tiles. Work in progress on the tile exchange function.

October 26, 2023:
- Updated test board.
- Updated board coordinates; I changed them because the ones in Slack didn't work with my board.

October 25, 2023:
- Added the __repr__ function to help visualize the cells on the board.
- Moved the main function from the game folder to the root of the scrabble folder. Now I can run the main, view the board, and playtest the game.

October 24, 2023:
- Made changes to the initialize_multipliers function. I encountered issues with the index going out of range.

October 23, 2023:
- Added tests to verify the functionality of the initialize_multipliers function.
    Tests include:
    Verifying correct assignment of double letter cell multipliers.
    Ensuring triple letter cell multipliers are set correctly.
    Validating the assignment of double word cell multipliers.
    Testing the proper assignment of triple word cell multipliers.

October 22, 2023:
- Added the function initialize_multipliers. This function assigns multipliers to board cells based on predefined coordinates and cell types. This enhancement helps ensure that the board's multipliers are set accurately.

October 21, 2023:
- Updated the is_empty function and the __init__ method in the Board class to initialize the board without any tiles.
- The is_empty function has been enhanced to accurately check whether a board cell is empty, ensuring precise gameplay logic. The __init__ method for the Board class now initializes the game board with empty cells, improving the clarity and correctness of the game's initial state.


October 20, 2023:
- Modifided the is_empty method to properly verify if the cell at position [7][7] is empty, ensuring that it returns True if the cell is empty and False if it contains a letter.
- Updated the __init__ method to initialize the board with empty cells by default. This ensures that the board starts in an empty state.
- Added a new method for validating word placement on the game board.
The new validate_word_place_board method enhances the functionality for verifying word placements, contributing to more accurate gameplay logic.
- However, it's important to note that there are issues with the unit tests for this functionality, specifically in the test_place_word_empty_board_vertical_wrong and test_place_word_empty_board_horizontal_wrong test cases. Im trying to figure out the problem with it.


October 11, 2023:
- Added the method show_board, is used to display the current state of the game board.
- I have been having trouble with writing test for validate_word function, Im using CodiumAI and ChatGPT for help but i still cant get it.
- Im also having troubles with the main.

October 3, 2023:
- Added the 'has letter' function for checking if a player has certain letters in their "tile inventory".

October 1, 2023:
- Added tests for dictionary
- Removed "word_validator" because I renamed it
- Renamed the file 'word_validator' to 'dictionary' for easier identification.

September 26, 2023:
- Added a function attempt to check if the board is empty, but its not working yet it has 4 failures and 1 error. Also, added a menu to the main that was not committed in the previous update.
- I have to ask how can i do to run the main and see a print of the board, type the number of players, etc.

September 25, 2023:
- Added the `WordValidator` class for word validation with the RAE dictionary.
    The `WordValidator` class has been introduced to facilitate word validation using the RAE (Real Academia Espa√±ola) dictionary. It provides methods to connect to the Pyrae API and validate words against the RAE dictionary.

September 24, 2023:
- Updated the main file to include a menu with multiple options.
    The main file has been enhanced with a user-friendly menu, offering the following options:

    2. Show Player Scores
    3. Place a Word on the Board
    4. Exchange Tiles
